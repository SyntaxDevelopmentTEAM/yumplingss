        <h2>Our Logo</h2>
        <p>
            Our logo originated from our thought of
            displaying the wide culture of Filipinos displaying
            that we can elevate a normal Filipino dish into
            something new and unusual. The character in our
            logo wearing a dumpling hat, is a playful take on our
            logo including a fanciful element, along with a Filipinos
            traditional costume, which is a barong that represents the
            Chinese - Filipino fusion of the food we offer. The character
            displays a distinctive approach which will make our brand stand out amongst other brands. We
            used the colors red for enhancing the customers appetite and the yellow color to grab the attention
            in accordance with The Psychology of Colors in Marketing.
             The logo, featuring a character in traditional Filipino attire and a unique dumpling
            hat, combines cultural symbols and culinary imagery to symbolize the integration of Filipino
            heritage and identity. The red background color symbolizes energy and elegance, while the yellow
            brand name adds brightness and captures the attention. This combination increases brand
            recognition and connects the logo with local heritage, expressing authenticity and pride. The logo
            aims to illustrate the harmonious blend of cultural roots and showcase the rich heritage of Filipino
            cuisine.
